# Yocto

## 00 Yocto Introduction

### What is Yocto?

**THE YOCTO PROJECT.  IT'S NOT AN EMBEDDED LINUX DISTRIBUTION, IT CREATES A CUSTOM ONE FOR YOU.**

https://www.yoctoproject.org/

### Why to use Yocto?

* To configure the Linux according to our specs. 
* The Image contains what we need.
*  No extra packages. 
* Small Image Size.

### What is the  Work-flow?

For now, not going in detail in Work-flow. Will see later in detail.

https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-overview/

In Later videos, we will try to understand the work flow in detail.

### Setup Host PC

#### Editor

* OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS)

* Using VSCode

  ```bash
  # Installing VS code using CLI
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install snapd
  sudo snap install --classic code
  ```

#### Install required packages

```bash
sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 xterm python3-subunit mesa-common-dev zstd liblz4-tool

```

### Building Image

#### What is Poky?

Poky is a *reference distribution* of the Yocto ProjectÂ®. It contains the OpenEmbedded Build System (BitBake and OpenEmbedded Core) as well as a set of metadata to get you started building your own distro. 

#### Cloning Poky

Create a project folder and clone the poky in it.

```bash
mkdir yocto_tutorial
cd yocto_tutorial
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky -b kirkstone
```

#### Initialize Build Environment

```bash
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
```

Now we are in **build** folder, there are some folders and files, right now the important is **conf** folder.

In terminal there are multiple image options

#### Create Source Folder (not necessary, but very much recommended)

From build folder run the following command

```bash
mkdir ../../sources
```

####  Make Changes in local.conf

* Change Machine

* Change source path

* Set following

* * RM_OLD_IMAGE = "1"

  * INHERIT += "rm_work"

* Save

We will discuss the content of **local.conf** file  in another chapter.

#### Build Image

Execute the following command from build folder

```bash
bibake core-image-full-cmdline
```

This will take a while, depending upon the Image and the specs of your system and the Internet connection.

On first build it will take time, later when we will make small changes, it will only build the changes, not the full image.

And will add these changes to our image file

#### Image File

Go to the **tmp** folder, my **tmp** folder is in my source folder, that we created before

I am opening a new terminal and going to the image folder.

```bash
cd ../../sources/tmp/deploy/images/beaglebone-yocto
```

Here is our Image : **core-image-full-cmdline-beaglebone-yocto.wic**

### End

In the next chapter I will show you how to flash the Image in beaglenone black and how to boot it.
